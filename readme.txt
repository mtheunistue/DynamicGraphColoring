This repository contains all the necessary files to reproduce the results from my dynamic graph coloring thesis.
The algorithm implementations are provided as standalone .py files, a misc.py file is provided with the random experiment
generating code, as well as any additonal functions that were useful during the project.
Additionally, the overnight experiment notebook file contains the code necessary to run any experiments
and save the results, either as a table or a plot.
The files starting with xyz_ are either older files, no longer in use, or files containing additional variants
of the algorithms, which were briefly considered, yet showed themselves to be of little interest.
Apart from all this, the graphs, update sequences and results from the thesis can all be found in the
experiments folder of this repository and can be opened using the code provided in misc.py and the overnight experiment file.
